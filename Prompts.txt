EduVerse - 8 Simple Build Prompts for Windsurf (100% FREE with OpenRouter)
Copy-paste these prompts one by one into Windsurf to build your MVP:

1. Home Screen & Navigation
Create a React app for EduVerse with a clean home screen showing the app name, a welcome message for students,
and a navigation bar with 4 buttons: "Ask Doubt", "Cheat Sheets", "Mindmap", and "Schedule". Use a
student-friendly color scheme with blue and white. Keep the design simple and mobile-responsive.

2. AI Doubt Solver (Text Input) - FREE with OpenRouter
Build an "Ask Doubt" page with a text input box where students can type their question, a submit button, and a
response area below. Integrate OpenRouter API (https://openrouter.ai) using completely free models like
"meta-llama/llama-3.2-3b-instruct:free" or "google/gemma-2-9b-it:free" or"microsoft/phi-3-mini-128k-instruct:free".
The AI should respond in a student-friendly way and mention which NCERT chapter/topic
(Class 11-12 Maths/Physics/Chemistry) the answer relates to. Display the AI's response with proper formatting.
Store the last 5 questions and answers in localStorage so the AI can reference them for context in future
questions.

3. Cheat Sheet Generator - FREE with OpenRouter
Create a "Cheat Sheets" page with an input field where students can enter a topic (like "Newton's Laws" or
"Organic Chemistry Reactions"). When they click "Generate", use OpenRouter's free models like
"meta-llama/llama-3.2-3b-instruct:free" to create a concise cheat sheet with 5-7 bullet points summarizing the
key concepts. Add a "Save" button that stores the cheat sheet in localStorage. Show a list of all saved cheat
sheets below, with options to view or delete each one.

4. Simple Mindmap Maker - FREE
Build a "Mindmap" page where students can create visual mind maps. Add a text input and "Add Node" button to
create boxes with text. Use React state and basic CSS for a simple draggable layout (or use the free library
"react-flow-renderer") where nodes can be connected with lines. Include buttons to "Add Child Node" (creates a
connected sub-node) and "Delete Node". Store mindmaps in localStorage. No external paid services needed.

5. Schedule Planner with AI - FREE with OpenRouter
Create a "Schedule" page with a form asking: "Which subjects are you studying?" (checkboxes for Maths, Physics,
Chemistry), and "How many hours can you study daily?" (dropdown 1-8 hours). When submitted, use OpenRouter's
free models like "meta-llama/llama-3.2-3b-instruct:free" to generate a simple weekly study schedule showing
which subjects to study on which days and for how long. Display the schedule in a clean table format and store
it in localStorage.

6. Study Timer & Daily Score - FREE
Add a study timer feature to the home screen with Start, Pause, and Stop buttons (default 25 minutes) using
JavaScript setInterval (no external services). Track total minutes studied today in localStorage. On the
Schedule page, show "Today's Goal" (from their schedule) vs "Actual Time Studied" and calculate a daily score
percentage. Reset the daily counter at midnight using JavaScript Date functions.

7. Memory & Conversation History - FREE
Create a "My Doubts" page that shows all previously asked questions and their answers in a timeline format,
newest first, all stored in localStorage. When a student asks a new doubt, retrieve the last 3-5 doubts from
localStorage and include them as context in the prompt to OpenRouter's free models so the model can give more
personalized responses like "Based on your previous question about kinematics...". Store all conversations
locally with timestamps.

8. Image Upload for Doubts - FREE with OpenRouter + OCR
Enhance the "Ask Doubt" page to allow students to upload an image of their question (from a textbook or
worksheet). Add an image upload button next to the text input. Use Tesseract.js (completely free, runs in
browser) to extract text from the image via OCR. Then send the extracted text to OpenRouter's free models
like "meta-llama/llama-3.2-3b-instruct:free" with the prompt "Solve this question and explain the solution
step-by-step. Mention which NCERT chapter this relates to." Display the AI's response below the image.
